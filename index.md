## About ZKProof

ZKProof is an open-industry academic initiative that seeks to mainstream zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography through an inclusive, community-driven standardization process that focuses on interoperability and security.

Annually-held ZKProof workshops, attended by world-renowned cryptographers, practitioners and industry leaders, are the optimal forum for discussing new proposals, reviewing cutting edge projects and advancing a community reference document that will ultimately serve as a trusted specification for the implementation of ZKP schemes and protocols.
